File name: jobListingController.js
Purpose: Contains methods which allow recruiters to create job listings, and there are also methods to retrieve the job listings from the database. 
Description: The API method createJobListing takes the request body containing job listing information from the UI form and writes it to the joblistings collection in the database.
             The other methods, getJobListing and getJobListings are used to retrieve job listings from the database to display on a UI. May eventually deprecate there methods based on need.
